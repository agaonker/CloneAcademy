# dice Documentation

## 1. Project Overview

### Purpose and Goals
*   **Primary Objectives:** To provide an open-source, high-performance, reactive, in-memory database optimized for modern hardware architectures. DiceDB aims to serve as a fast caching layer or primary in-memory data store.
*   **Intended Use Cases:**
    *   Caching layer for web applications and services.
    *   Real-time data synchronization and propagation (e.g., dashboards, live updates).
    *   Session storage.
    *   Leaderboards and rate limiting.
    *   Message queuing (potentially, depending on specific features).
*   **Target Audience:** Developers and organizations requiring a fast, low-latency data store with real-time update capabilities. This includes backend developers, system architects, and DevOps engineers.
*   **Business or Technical Problems Solved:** Addresses the need for databases that can handle high throughput and provide low median latencies, typical of modern, demanding workloads. It also simplifies real-time application development by offering built-in query subscription features, reducing the need for complex polling or custom notification systems.
*   **Unique Value Proposition:** Combines the speed and familiarity of traditional in-memory caches (like Redis) with reactive capabilities (query subscriptions) out-of-the-box, optimized for performance on contemporary hardware.

### Key Features
*   **In-Memory Storage:** Data is primarily held in RAM for maximum speed. *(Persistence options like snapshotting or AOF might exist but are not detailed in the provided information).*
*   **High Throughput & Low Latency:** Designed and optimized for speed, leveraging modern hardware capabilities (likely efficient concurrency and memory management).
*   **Reactive Capabilities:** Supports query subscriptions, allowing clients to receive real-time updates when the data relevant to their queries changes.
*   **Familiar Interface:** Aims to provide an interface commonly understood by developers, likely similar to Redis or other popular key-value stores. *(Specific command set needs verification).*
*   **Docker Support:** Easy deployment and setup using official Docker images.
*   **Dedicated CLI:** Provides a command-line interface (`dicedb-cli`) for interaction and management.
*   **SDKs:** Implies the existence of Software Development Kits for various programming languages to interact with the database. *(Specific languages need verification).*

### Technology Stack
*   **Programming Language:** Go (Inferred from `.golangci.yaml`, `.goreleaser.yaml` files). Go is well-suited for building high-performance, concurrent network services like databases.
*   **Database and Storage:** DiceDB *is* the database; it utilizes system memory (RAM) as its primary storage medium. *(Details on underlying data structures or potential disk persistence mechanisms require code analysis).*
*   **External Services and Dependencies:** Likely minimal core dependencies beyond the Go standard library. Specific Go modules used require inspection of `go.mod` (not provided).
*   **Development and Deployment Tools:**
    *   Docker: For containerized deployment (`README.md`).
    *   Git & GitHub: For version control and collaboration.
    *   `golangci-lint`: For Go code linting (`.golangci.yaml`).
    *   `goreleaser`: For automating build and release processes (`.goreleaser.yaml`).
    *   `pre-commit`: For running checks before commits (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`).

## 3. Core Components

**(Note:** This section describes *hypothetical* components based on the project's nature. Actual implementation requires code analysis.)

### Main Modules
*   **Network Listener/Server (`internal/server` - Inferred):** Responsible for accepting incoming client connections (likely TCP on port 7379), managing connection lifecycles, and reading client requests.
*   **Protocol Parser (`internal/protocol` - Inferred):** Parses the raw byte stream from clients into structured commands and arguments that the database engine can understand. Serializes responses back into the wire format.
*   **Command Dispatcher/Executor (`internal/command` - Inferred):** Receives parsed commands, validates them, potentially handles authentication/authorization, and routes them to the appropriate execution logic. Implements the database's command set (e.g., GET, SET, SUBSCRIBE).
*   **Storage Engine (`internal/store` - Inferred):** The core component managing the in-memory data structures (e.g., hash maps for keys, potentially lists, sets, sorted sets). Handles CRUD operations, expiration, and ensures data consistency (likely via mutexes or other concurrency controls).
*   **Subscription Manager (`internal/pubsub` - Inferred):** Manages client subscriptions to specific queries or data patterns. Tracks which clients are interested in which data and notifies them when relevant data changes occur, enabling the "reactive" feature.
*   **Configuration Manager (`internal/config` - Inferred):** Loads and provides access to runtime configuration settings (ports, logging levels, persistence options, etc.).
*   **(Optional) Persistence Manager (`internal/persistence` - Inferred):** If persistence is supported, this module would handle saving in-memory data to disk (e.g., snapshotting RDB-style, or appending to a log AOF-style) and loading it back on startup.

### Key Classes and Functions
*   **`Server` struct (Inferred):** Likely represents the main database server instance, holding references to the listener, storage engine, subscription manager, etc. Methods like `Start()`, `Stop()`.
*   **`ClientConn` struct (Inferred):** Represents a single client connection, handling reading requests and writing responses for that client.
*   **`Store` interface/struct (Inferred):** Defines and implements the core data storage operations (e.g., `Get(key)`, `Set(key, value, ttl)`, `Delete(key)`).
*   **`Command` interface/struct (Inferred):** Represents a database command, possibly using the Command design pattern for execution. Each command (SET, GET, SUB, etc.) could be a specific implementation.
*   **`Subscription` struct (Inferred):** Represents an active client subscription, holding the query/pattern and the client connection to notify.
*   **Data Structure Implementations (Inferred):** Underlying Go structs implementing hash maps (`map`), potentially concurrent-safe maps (`sync.Map` or custom), lists (`[]slice` or linked lists), etc.

### Data Structures
*   **Main Data Models:** Primarily key-value based. Keys are likely strings. Values could support various types (strings, integers, potentially lists, hashes, sets, similar to Redis). Schema is likely flexible/schemaless beyond the basic key-value structure.
*   **In-Memory Representation:** Go maps (`map[string]interface{}` or more specific types) are likely used for the main key space. Concurrent access probably managed via `sync.RWMutex` for locking or potentially specialized concurrent data structures.
*   **Subscription Data:** Data structures (e.g., maps or trees) are needed to efficiently map data keys/patterns to subscribed client connections.
*   **Data Transformation:** Minimal transformation expected at the core, primarily parsing/serialization at the protocol layer.
*   **State Management:** Server state (data, subscriptions, configuration) is managed within the running Go process's memory.
*   **Caching:** DiceDB itself is often *used* as a cache. Internal caching mechanisms are unlikely unless related to specific optimizations (e.g., caching command parsing results).
*   **Persistence Strategies:** Primarily in-memory. If persistence exists (not confirmed), common strategies are:
    *   **Snapshotting:** Point-in-time dumps of the dataset to disk.
    *   **Append-Only File (AOF):** Logging every write operation to a file.
    *(Requires verification from code or documentation).*

## 4. Key Files Analysis

### Documentation Files
*   **`README.md`:** Provides a high-level overview, project goals, quick start instructions (Docker, CLI), contribution pointers, sponsor information, and license details. Essential starting point for users and contributors.
*   **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`:** Outlines expected behavior and standards for community participation, fostering a positive environment.
*   **`LICENSE`:** Contains the BSD 3-Clause license text, defining usage and distribution rights and limitations.
*   **`CONTRIBUTING.md` (Inferred, referenced in README):** Expected to contain detailed guidelines for developers wanting to contribute, covering code style, testing, workflow, and setup.

### Configuration Files

*   **`.goreleaser.yaml`:** Defines the build, packaging, and release process managed by `goreleaser`. Specifies build targets (OS/Arch), archive formats, Docker image creation, and release notes generation for GitHub Releases.
*   **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`:** Configures hooks managed by the `pre-commit` framework. These hooks likely run linters (`golangci-lint`), formatters (`gofmt`), and other checks automatically before code is committed, ensuring baseline quality.
*   **(Potential) `dicedb.conf` / `config.yaml` (Inferred):** A runtime configuration file for the DiceDB server itself might exist (though not listed) to control port, persistence settings, log levels, memory limits, etc.

### Source Files
*(Note: Specific file paths are inferred)*
*   **Main Entry Points:**
    *   `cmd/dicedb/main.go` (Inferred): Initializes and starts the DiceDB server process. Parses command-line flags/config file, sets up logging, creates the main server instance, and starts the network listener.
*   **Core Business Logic:**
    *   `internal/store/...` (Inferred): Implementation of data storage, retrieval, deletion, expiration logic. Contains the core in-memory data structures.
    *   `internal/command/...` (Inferred): Implementation logic for each database command (e.g., `set.go`, `get.go`, `subscribe.go`).
    *   `internal/pubsub/...` (Inferred): Logic for managing subscriptions and dispatching real-time updates to clients.
*   **Utility and Helper Functions:**
    *   `internal/protocol/...` (Inferred): Functions for parsing client requests and serializing server responses.
    *   `pkg/utils/...` or `internal/util/...` (Inferred): Common helper functions used across the codebase (e.g., error handling utilities, string manipulation).
*   **Test Suites:**
    *   Files ending in `_test.go` located alongside the code they test (e.g., `internal/store/store_test.go`). Contain unit tests using Go's built-in `testing` package. Integration or end-to-end tests might reside in a dedicated `test/` directory.

## 5. Dependencies and Requirements

### External Dependencies
*   **Go Standard Library:** Core networking (`net`), concurrency (`sync`), I/O (`io`), data structures, encoding (`encoding/json` etc.), testing (`testing`).
*   **Go Modules (Inferred):** Specific third-party Go modules listed in `go.mod` (not provided). Could potentially include:
    *   A logging library (e.g., `logrus`, `zap`).
    *   A CLI framework (e.g., `cobra`, `urfave/cli`) if the CLI is part of this repo.
    *   Libraries for specific data structures or performance optimizations.
    *   Protocol buffers library if gRPC or Protobuf is used internally.
*   **Version Compatibility:** Requires a specific version range of the Go compiler (defined in `go.mod`). Compatibility needed for any listed Go modules.
*   **Alternative Options:** Generally relies on the Go ecosystem. Alternatives are usually different Go libraries providing similar functionality.
*   **Security Considerations:** Dependencies should be audited for vulnerabilities (e.g., using `govulncheck`). Supply chain security is important.

### Development Setup
*   **Environment:** Go compiler toolchain (specific version from `go.mod`), Git, Make (likely), Docker (recommended for running/testing), `pre-commit` tool.
*   **Build/Test Dependencies:** `golangci-lint`, `goreleaser`. Any specific libraries needed for tests.
*   **IDE:** Any Go-supporting IDE (VS Code with Go extension, GoLand) is suitable. Standard Go tooling (`gofmt`, `go test`, `go build`) is essential.
*   **Debugging/Profiling:** Go's built-in debugging (`delve`) and profiling (`pprof`) tools.

### Runtime Requirements
*   **System:** Runs on common OS supporting Go (Linux, macOS, Windows). Requires sufficient RAM as it's an in-memory database; the amount depends heavily on the dataset size. Adequate CPU resources for handling client connections and commands.
*   **Performance:** Designed for high throughput/low latency. Performance depends on hardware (RAM speed, CPU cores), network bandwidth/latency, and workload patterns (command mix, data size).
*   **Scaling:** Primarily scales vertically (more RAM/CPU on a single node). Horizontal scaling (clustering, sharding) is complex for stateful systems like databases and its support in DiceDB is not confirmed in the provided info. The reactive nature might add complexity to clustered setups.
*   **Monitoring/Logging:** Requires setup for monitoring resource usage (RAM, CPU, Network I/O) and application logs for errors and performance metrics. *(Specific metrics exposed need verification).*

## 6. Architecture and Design

**(Note:** This section is a high-level inference based on typical database design and the project's description.)

### System Architecture
*   **High-Level Design:** Likely a single-process server application listening on a network port (TCP 7379). It employs an event-driven or multi-threaded/goroutine-based model to handle concurrent client connections.
*   **Component Interaction:**
    1.  Client connects.
    2.  Listener accepts connection, potentially spawns a goroutine per client.
    3.  Client Goroutine reads request data from the socket.
    4.  Protocol Parser decodes the request into a command object.
    5.  Command Dispatcher routes the command to the appropriate handler function.
    6.  Handler function interacts with the Storage Engine (for data operations) and/or Subscription Manager.
    7.  Storage Engine performs reads/writes on in-memory data structures, using locking (e.g., `sync.RWMutex`) for safety.
    8.  Subscription Manager registers/unregisters subscriptions or queues notifications if data changes.
    9.  Response (or acknowledgment) is generated.
    10. Protocol Serializer encodes the response.
    11. Client Goroutine writes the response back to the socket.
    *(For subscriptions, the Subscription Manager pushes updates to relevant Client Goroutines asynchronously)*.
*   **Data Flow:** Client Request -> Parser -> Dispatcher -> Engine/Manager(s) -> Response -> Serializer -> Client. Updates triggered by writes flow Engine -> Subscription Manager -> Subscribed Clients.
*   **Error Handling:** Go's explicit error handling (`if err != nil`) is expected throughout. Errors likely propagated back to the client according to the defined protocol. Robust handling of network errors, parsing errors, and command execution errors is crucial.

### Design Patterns
*   **Concurrency:** Goroutines per connection, or a worker pool model for command execution. Use of `sync` package primitives (Mutex, RWMutex, WaitGroup, channels) for managing concurrency safely.
*   **Network:** Listener/Acceptor pattern for handling incoming connections. Non-blocking I/O likely used for efficiency.
*   **Command Processing:** Command pattern might be used to encapsulate requests as objects. Strategy pattern could select the execution logic based on the command type.
*   **Subscriptions:** Observer pattern is central to the reactive feature, where the Subscription Manager (subject) notifies subscribed clients (observers) of changes.
*   **Data Storage:** Hash Map for key-value lookups. Potentially other structures (Skip Lists for sorted sets, Linked Lists for lists) depending on supported data types.

### Scalability and Performance
*   **Scaling:** Primarily vertical (more RAM/CPU). Horizontal scaling (sharding/clustering) features are unconfirmed but would significantly increase architectural complexity (data distribution, consistency, subscription propagation across nodes).
*   **Performance Optimization:**
    *   Efficient Go concurrency patterns (minimizing lock contention, using channels appropriately).
    *   Optimized in-memory data structures.
    *   Non-blocking network I/O.
    *   Efficient protocol parsing/serialization.
    *   Potential use of memory pooling (`sync.Pool`) to reduce GC pressure.
*   **Resource Utilization:** RAM is the primary resource constraint. CPU usage scales with the number of concurrent clients and command complexity. Network I/O depends on request/response sizes and throughput.
*   **Monitoring:** Exposing key metrics (e.g., via Prometheus endpoint or specific commands like `INFO`) is crucial for production: memory usage, connected clients, commands processed per second, hit rate (if used as cache), subscription count, latency percentiles.

## 7. Development Guidelines

### Code Style and Standards
*   **Conventions:** Standard Go formatting (`gofmt`), naming conventions, and effective Go principles. Enforced via `golangci-lint` (configuration in `.golangci.yaml`).
*   **Documentation:** GoDoc comments for public APIs (`pkg/`) and important internal components. `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` provide project-level documentation.
*   **Testing:** Unit tests (`*_test.go`) expected for core logic using the standard `testing` package. High test coverage is desirable. Integration tests likely verify interactions between components.
*   **Review:** Pull Request based workflow on GitHub, requiring reviews and passing CI checks (linting, tests) before merging.

### Development Workflow
*   **Branching:** Likely Gitflow or GitHub flow (feature branches off `master`/`main`, PRs for review/merge).
*   **CI/CD:** Continuous Integration (CI) likely triggered on PRs/merges (using GitHub Actions or similar), running checks defined in `.golangci.yaml` and executing tests. Continuous Deployment (CD) potentially handled by `goreleaser` for creating GitHub releases and Docker images upon tagging.
*   **Release Management:** Managed via `goreleaser`, triggered by Git tags. Creates binaries, archives, Docker images, and publishes GitHub Releases. Semantic versioning is expected.
*   **QA:** Automated tests (unit, integration) run in CI. Manual testing may occur before releases. Community testing via beta releases or Docker images.

### Best Practices
*   **Security:** Input validation at the protocol layer, careful resource management to prevent DoS (e.g., memory limits), consideration for authentication/authorization mechanisms (details unknown), dependency vulnerability scanning.
*   **Performance:** Profiling (`pprof`) to identify bottlenecks, benchmarking key operations, minimizing lock contention, optimizing data structure choices, reducing allocations/GC pressure.
*   **Error Handling:** Consistent and explicit error handling using Go's `error` type. Avoid panics for recoverable errors. Provide clear error messages to clients.
*   **Logging:** Structured logging (e.g., JSON format) with configurable levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR). Log key events, errors, and potentially slow operations. Avoid excessive logging in hot paths.
*   **Configuration:** Provide sensible defaults. Allow configuration via file and/or environment variables/flags.
